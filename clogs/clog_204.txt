Improvments / Bug Fixes

- OTA system completely rewrited.
- Import / Export backups functions completely rewrited.
- A lot of base methods (in calonz.instafel) rewrited for stability.
- IFL and IG About menu merged
- Added OverrideManager for optimized flag operations

With this release, most of the methods that have been used since the first version of instafel have changed (you could even say that I rebuilt the application from scratch). So don't forget to report any problems in the Telegram group.
